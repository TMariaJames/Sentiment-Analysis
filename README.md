# Sentiment-Analysis
This paper conducts a detailed data analysis report on detecting real or fake job 
postings on internet. The properties of Natural Language Processing is done to 
determine whether the job posting is real or fake. Several models are tried and 
the best model to classify the classes are determined using the performance of 
these models. A deep learning algorithm using CNN and RNN is also trained 
with respect to the job description and the labels.
